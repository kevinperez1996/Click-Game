# Clicky

## Summary

Clicky is an app that tests your memory. It is your job to remember which images you have clicked, while all images shuffle. 
Users should start by clicking their image of choice. Once clicked, all images will be shuffled, and placed in a new random spot. 
It is the user's job to remember what image they clicked on originally and avoid clicking it again. The process repeats itself, each time the user clicks a new image. Click on each image only once to win the game. Good Luck!
